The Discover Cryptography program intruduces students to modular arithmetic as a gateway to various methods of public key cryptography, and touches on the workings of state-of-the-art private key cryptography methods such as RSA.

Students should be comfortable with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finding remainders when dividing as a prerequisite to this workshop. Click [here](/dm-cryptography/) for an insight of some of the content covered in the workshop.
