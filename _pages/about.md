Discover Maths was founded in November 2023 with the aim of raising attainment through widening access and participation in Mathematics.

We host Mathematics workshops for all ages, both online and in-person, during evenings and weekends, and are also open to working with local schools and colleges to offer programs within their institutions. Our workshops aim to raise attainment in Mathematics by presenting high-level or otherwise monotonous topics in Mathematics in easy-to-access and exciting ways. See our [programs page](/programs/) for more information, and [get in contact](mailto:hello@discovermaths.uk) to enquire about attending one of our events or booking an event at your institution.

At present, Discover Maths is a one-man show operated by [Shay Jordan](https://shayjordan.co.uk), a Master of Mathematics graduate from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK. Shay is also a qualified teacher, but chooses to devote his time to educational outreach activities rather than classroom teaching.
