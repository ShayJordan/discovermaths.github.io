Discover Maths was founded in November 2023 with the aim of feeding curious minds in Mathematics.

###Featured Programs

{% include gallery id="gallery1" layout="half" %}

We host Mathematics workshops for all ages and abilities, both online and in-person, during evenings and weekends, and are also open to working with local schools and colleges to offer programs within their institutions. Our workshops aim to widen access to high-level or otherwise monotonous topics in Mathematics in engaging, easy-to-access, and exciting ways -- built upon a low-threshold, high ceiling approach to teaching. 

For more information on our programs, click [here](/programs/), and [get in contact](mailto:hello@discovermaths.uk) to enquire about attending one of our events or booking an event at your institution.
